## 个人简介

> 我于2023年5月加入上海交通大学电子信息与电气工程学院微纳电子学系，任长聘教轨助理教授。此前，我于2017年从北京大学博士毕业，主攻人工智能加速器研究。期间于2015-2016前往美国加州大学洛杉矶分校学术访问。毕业后加入微软亚洲研究院，从事“云-边-端”人工智能系统及其异构加速。任职至主管研究员（Senior Researcher）。于2021年初加入阿里巴巴平头哥半导体有限公司并行计算团队。作为核心芯片架构师，负责分布式人工智能算法加速及集群芯片互联相关功能设计。

## Biography

> I joined the Department of Micro-Nano Electronics at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in May 2023. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Peking University in 2017, specializing in research on artificial intelligence accelerators. During my doctoral studies, I conducted academic visits at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2015-2016 [Alumni page](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/alumni/chen-zhang). After graduation, I joined Microsoft Research, where I worked on cloud-edge-end artificial intelligence systems and heterogeneous acceleration. I progressed to the position of Senior Researcher. In early 2021, I joined Alibaba T-head Semiconductor Co., Ltd., leading the parallel computing team as a Core Chip Architect, responsible for artificial intelligence algorithm acceleration and cluster chip interconnect-related functional design.
