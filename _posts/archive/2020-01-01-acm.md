截至2022年底，我发表在FPGA-2015的论文《Optimizing fpga-based accelerator design for deep convolutional neural networks》在[ACM Library](https://dl.acm.org/conference/fpga)上引用量和下载量排名第一，打破29年以来FPGA领域相关记录。

As the end of 2022, my paper titled "Optimizing FPGA-based accelerator design for deep convolutional neural networks," published at FPGA-2015, has been cited and downloaded the most, ranking Top-1 in [ACM Library](https://dl.acm.org/conference/fpga). This achievement breaks the previous record in the field of FPGA-related research for the past 29 years.
